# S7_force_restart
If watchdog isn't enough, this is a simple script to force a restart of the cgminer

In the antminer, it isn't possible to store permanently the file, so to launch this script you must copy or create trought ssh.
After this you can launch it with

nohup sh ./S7_restart.sh &

After you can disconnect the terminal.
